		<!-- INSERT BLOG HERE -->

		Javascript constructors are used to create multiple instances of that object. So if you have a “fruit” constructor, you can make an instance of strawberries and an instance of apples that will share the same coding guts defined in the constructor. With this multiple instance feature, it is easy to compare it with the ruby class, but they differ in how you can manipulate them. Ruby classes have the specialty of communicating with other classes as well as being completely aware of other class instances. I haven’t had as much experience with JS constructors yet, but from initial usage, they aren’t aware of other instances that share the same constructor. Their specialty lies in how you can add features to the instance from outside of the constructor. This is unlike ruby classes where all features and properties are defined inside the class. Ruby classes and JS constructors still share the same purpose of holding functions/methods/data which can be called through dot notation.
