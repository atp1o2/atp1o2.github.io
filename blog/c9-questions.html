		The perfect question is supposed to inspire me to answer it. What an odd yet enticing concept. Its natural for people to skip tasks that don't really benefit them, especially over the internet where “somebody else” will do it. Despite this, I have seen a few questions on stack overflow where I was inspired to answer the questions. It takes a succinct, detailed title followed by a unidirectional introduction to setup the question. I found that writing very minimal code works the best because the answerers will most likely try to come up with the most elegant and refactored piece of code in their answer. For some questions, putting up the “final answer” you desire in your question and waiting for the actual punch-line of the code can be the most effective. I think the most effective questions are the ones that challenge the community to explore many different answers to solve the problem. The answerers almost try to one-up each other in their solutions, but still uphold a camaraderie towards the pursuit of better code. So how do you get these kinds of questions and solutions going? The trick is to be as specific as possible with your question using the least amount of words and code possible. When a question that has enough breathing room to accept all sorts of different solutions to answer one question, you have a perfect question.
