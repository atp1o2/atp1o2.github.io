    <!-- INSERT BLOG HERE -->
    A topic that I have always been interested in is the successfulness or, more likely, the unsuccessfulness of tech startup companies. From what I gathered in asking employees of startup companies is the lack of direction. Besides the challenge of producing a viable product, startups struggle with having a clear view of the end goal, how to achieve it, and what to do afterwards if they do achieve it. A common complaint is how poor management can be in holistically focusing the team(s) on the short and long term goals. Too often, management focuses too much on meeting metrics and loses track of the team’s health, inhibiting that team’s potential to grow towards the end goal. We’re not talking physical health here, but the overall attitude of the employees – their drive. So how do we fix a company’s health?

    Good company culture is always what everyone thinks is the answer, but from my talks, it is not enough. You have probably have heard a worker at a startup say, “Working here is really chill. People are nice, free food, and the work space is cool but…”, but the company hires lazy employees, but the work itself isn’t satisfying, but the company doesn’t really know what they are doing. So a lot easier to write than to do, but a startup that focuses on building a strong visionary management team that spends time hiring honest workers that actually commit to their job, provides progressive work duties, and constantly strengthens the company’s vision, will ultimately improve the health and drive of employees. Employees that feel invested in will more likely than not, invest their efforts back into the company.
