		<!-- INSERT BLOG HERE -->

		Through life, there are always some people that connect seamlessly with your personality, some that can coexist cordially, and some that just don’t get you. I often wondered what that x factor was that kept two friendly people from connecting. Maybe it was the cultural differences or the difference life priorities. Maybe it was the difference intelligence or economic class. Much later on in my life, I realized that it really wasn’t any of the above and I found out that people connect when their values are the same. I’ve had friends of every difference I listed above, but the common thread I found within all of them is their honesty. Not the truth or lies type honesty, but when a person is honest about who they are and what they really enjoy. In today’s age, it’s really easy to fall into social media traps about how we should act and look which can cause some loss in genuineness. <br>
		In facing stereotype threat, I know that being honest with myself is a good start it identifying and staunching its effect. I want to learn all of the stereotype threats to being an Asian American in the coding field and not dismiss them to be funny stereotypes that don’t apply to me. Learning about stereotype threat made me realize that it has happened all my life without me knowing it. Now that I am more aware, I can be more reflective of a situation and ask myself (honestly) if it’s my personal performance that is lacking or if stereotype threat has a hand in play.
