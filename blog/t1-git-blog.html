        Welcome to the first entry in this blog. The way I like to learn is by comparing the new material to a system I already know the ins and outs to, and finding the key differences that separates them. So here is my take on explaining version control. Version control is a system that will take the code you wrote, in whatever language, and create a new version of that file. From this point, every time you decide to save any changes to that file, version control will create another newer version of that version while keeping the previous version. So in total, you have two different versions that you can return to at any time. Contrast this to Microsoft Word, where saving a document will overwrite the same file. Git is just a type of version control system. What makes git popular is its git tracking feature, which forces you to log every change you made to a file and keeping previous versions of that file in progressive branches.

        Now that we are using Git to keep track of all the changes in our file, we can upload (push) these changes to a remote online hub known as, Github. Github will store and log every change you make to your files for everyone to see. Yes, anyone can view, take, copy, use the public codes you commit to Github. It seems odd, but this is exactly what you want when working with a team of developers working on the same project. Everyone can simultaneously upload their latest version for others to build upon while maintaining previous versions in case there's a mistake. 

        Neat, isn't it?
