What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?

The display selector defines how an element is well, displayed. It can make the element act like a box, a tight group of text, or a combination of both. Depending on the property chosen, different margin rules and alignments are assigned. An inline property is usually reserved for smaller text level elements (like <span>) and allows other elements to sit to their left & right on the same line. It does not respect top & bottom margins nor accept height/width settings. An inline-block is very similar in that it allows elements to sit to the left & right of it on the same line. The differences are that it accepts height/width settings to form box dimensions, accepts top & bottom margins, and has whitespace around it. This allows it to be formatted on the document much more freely. I typically use inline displays for a row of hyperlinks and use inline-blocks to format the bigger areas of the document, like a blog post.
