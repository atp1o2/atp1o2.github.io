    <h1>Stereotypes hurt more than you think</h1>
    <h2>Threats to your performance</h2>

In one sentence, stereotype threat is an underperformance of your true abilities due to factors involving your culture, race, or gender. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy problem where situations are affected by racial stereotypes, causing unconscious behaviors that cause you to fall into those negative stereotypes. I know I’ve fallen prey to stereotype threat many times in my life, but I never knew that it had a name or that it was that so explicitly studied. The easiest example for me to talk about is my experience of going through college as an Asian biochemistry student at UC Davis. To be honest, I was just another person in a major saturated by excellent Asian colleagues. It always seemed like the 90th percentile of the exams were filled with the Asian and White students, causing me to feel like I wasn’t keeping up with the Asian stereotypes of succeeding in this field and doubly frustrating because the white students were always surprised when I wouldn’t do well on a test. This dynamic stuck with me throughout my entire academic career. At times it made me hate my major, at times it made me work harder, but overall it made me feel like I chose the wrong major. I understand now that worrying about my place in comparison to my classmates caused me to underperform and distracted me from really appreciating the material.  <br>
Once again, I’m going into a field with notable stereotypes. The difference now is I’m more comfortable with my social awareness which came with age, but an even bigger factor is this new knowledge of identifying stereotype threats. If I can identify and reflect on these threats, I believe it will help me push it aside to focus on the actual tasks at hand.
