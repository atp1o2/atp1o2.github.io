    <!-- INSERT BLOG HERE -->
Anybody with some Ruby skills can create a new class object with some methods inside. The beauty and strength of coding is how well designed these classes are. A class that has methods with the sole purpose of producing the correct output is fine for that moment, but will inevitably break as time goes on. This is because needs change and requirements change causing change in the code. A great piece of code is designed to embrace change. That’s a very idealistic thought, but how is it implemented? The “simplest” feature to start adding to your code is to create methods with a singular responsibility. I like to ask myself what the method does, and if I have two answers, the method has too many responsibilities. This concept more importantly applies to classes. Combine this mindset into class methods, and you will ideally have methods act independently but synergistically with each other. This means methods should not have too much information on another allowing changes to not break the entire code
