    <!-- INSERT BLOG HERE -->
Why do we have these two data structures that basically do the same thing - hold data? It’s because they hold data differently is the obvious answer. You can think of arrays as a list of groceries that you can edit. You can add carrots to that list of groceries and delete potatoes after you’ve purchased them. Now arrays get a lot more complicated in the methods you can perform on them. For example, say you had a program that can cycle through your grocery list and spits out a calorie readout for each item. While basic, this is an example of iterating through an array. You can also iterate through a hash, but a hash holds information differently. I like to think of it as a contact book where you write down the person’s name on the line written “First Name”. Now our contact book (hash) has the key, “First Name” equal to the value “Andrew”. You can also iterate over either the keys or values in a hash. An easy iteration would be to iterate over only the hash values and print each value out. You’ll most likely stick to arrays when the data type is all strings, integers, or other objects. Hashes are usually used when you have a combination of different data types. Using our phonebook example, “Age” is a string and the value 24 would be an integer. Over time, the decision to use one over the other will come naturally.
