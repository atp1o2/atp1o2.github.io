   I applied to other coding schools at first, in particular, App Academy for its tuition waiver. I have to say that their application process was quite informal. When I applied to Dev Bootcamp, the personal and formal application process immediately separated it from any of the coding applications I've done in the past. After I got in, I expected to jump right into the grind of learning new languages and programming structures. I open the introductory email and was hit with a ton of videos, articles, talks, and materials all about…the betterment of my own life? There were talks about creating helpful methods to stay focused, insight into past students experiences, and articles about how to create the version of yourself you want to be. I immediately got inspired to do more than just code. I took up daily meditations, created new micro-habits, and focused on creating a clear headspace for learning. My expectation of DBC at first was just another school that took 14,000$ away from my bank account with assurances of success, but I’m discovering a community that really strives to personally connect and propel every member of its community with its vast resources and knowledge. I can feel an unprecedented motivation to succeed in programming that I’ve haven’t experienced before. I know it’s bad form to say this too soon, but I hope it’s okay if I say, “I love Dev Bootcamp.”
