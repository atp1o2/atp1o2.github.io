      When I researched more into abstract random, I actually believe that DBC caters to the abstract random thinking learning style. Some of the key points of AR emphasizes on is establishing healthy harmonious relations with group members, listening to others, reflections on personal feelings and thoughts about a subject, and working in an open and collaborative environment. My remote study at DBC so far has been surprisingly unprecedented in how much I enjoy learning and working with this community. It’s a feeling I never got in college where things were very competitive with grades and restrictive in learning styles. That’s not to say I haven’t struggled at times with the material. In particular, I struggled with the basic concepts of GitHub and CSS positioning because I had to learn it from reading text and practicing it on my own. The subjects only became clear in my mind during both of my GPS sessions where the guide personally nudged me into the right direction. AR really emphasizes on interactively working with a group, and while I do enjoy the different perspectives, I find that I work best alone. I put a lot of energy into group harmony and inclusiveness when I’m working with a group, but working alone allows me to channel that energy into the tasks at hand without feeling any pressure to interact with the group. When working alone, having expert references also makes me feel at ease knowing that I can ask for help when I absolutely need to. This style of working falls under abstract sequential, which I believe I picked up along with my biochemistry degree. I find that DBC has a good mixture of group and individual learning that works really well for both learning styles.

      The subject of fixed versus growth mindset is incredibly biased towards growth. Of course we want to believe ourselves to persist through every challenge and to learn from every experience. I suppose the point of the article is to not actually identify fixed versus growth mindset people, but to change any fixed minded tendencies into a growth mindset. So the article should honestly be renamed to that, “The Change from Fixed Mindsets to Growth Mindsets”, because the article can make you feel a little ashamed of fixed mindset tendencies if you’re being honest with yourself. Maybe that’s enough to change some people, but I’m betting those with fixed mindsets will avoid the challenge. Once again, I believe we all want to think we have a growth mindset, but I know that I have some fixed mindset characteristics that I want to change. Touche, biased article.
