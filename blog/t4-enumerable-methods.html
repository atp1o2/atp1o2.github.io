      To start talking about enumerable, we have to define what this weird word even means. An enumerable is a collection of methods that runs some type of sorting method on a data structure (array, hash, etc). Any enumerable will use #each as part of its function to iterate through each element of your data structure. So to provide the most basic of examples, calling #each on array = [1, 2, 3] will first select the element “1”, run whatever code you specify, and then start again on “2”, run the code, and so on until #each element has passed through the code. That is the basic premise of an enumerable. 
      <br>
There are many methods in this class that do variations on what I just discussed, but I want to discuss a very common enumerable that is easily confused with #each. The enumerable #each will run the code block on each element, but the return value (output) is actually discarded if you don’t specify a destination for it. So you have a code that adds +1 to each element, the end result will still return [1, 2, 3]. Contrast this to #map, which will run the code block and return the values in a new object with those changes. This means that the original array stays intact, but the output will be [2,3,4].  There are many situations where you’ll just want to use #each for its side-effect of “temporarily” producing an output and #map for its return of a new object with the new changes.
