		<!-- INSERT BLOG HERE -->
		I have this ongoing drama with two very important people in my life, who I will call Lena and Joey. After Lena worked hard for years and years, all she wanted to do was take a vacation for her physical, mental, and relationship health. Lena and I have playfully discussed the dream vacation at times, joking about how Lena would collapse in any climate with hot weather. When an argument happened between Lena and Joey, it triggered a serious consideration for Lena to go on this vacation. I helped her plan how she would do it - where, when, with who, and for how long. The more we discussed about it, the more excited we got, but the more Joey dismissed it. Eventually, Joey said he would leave if Lena went on the vacation. Reluctantly, we dropped the plans. 
		<br>
		<br>
I became increasingly edgy and angry about the situation. I was angry at Joey for using the vacation as a weapon against her, but I couldn’t understand why I was so frustrated all the time at Lena too. I would snap and have cutting remarks at every turn.  I ignored Lena and Joey for awhile, secretly hoping that they both might come to their senses while I calmed myself down. Eventually, I realized I was angry at Lena for not taking a stand towards her own happiness, something I believe everyone should do full-heartedly. I was angry at Joey for his lack of reflectiveness for himself and the situation. I was angry with myself for feeling helpless in the situation. 
<br><br>
I talked to Lena about how I felt and apologized for the way I was acting. The bond between me and Lena began healing immediately, but I haven’t discussed anything with Joey yet. I’ve come to realize that I can’t control other people’s lives no matter how much I think it will help them. The best I can do is always being there when they need me. If I could go back, I would have directed my anger at something else, maybe at a tree or how my coffee tasted, something that didn’t care about human words. I should have used all that energy to reflect on why I was angry earlier instead of putting it into vocal force. It’s hard for me to see the people I love in pain, but all I can do is be patient and keeping hoping that with more care, we can all move onto a real resolution.
