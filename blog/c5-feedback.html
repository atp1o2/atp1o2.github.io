The first week of pairing was the most nerve wracking for me because I was worried about my skill level and performance. It was pretty clear through one of the cultural assignments that this was pretty much everyone’s fear though. It almost feels like we all got duped into working harder in order to avoid that feeling of inadequacy for the pairing sessions. So what I am trying to say is, the pairing system is quite masterful at keeping everyone sharp and on top of their game.
<br>
Now I actually enjoy the sessions. Phil B. and I have paired three times now and the flow gets better and better every time. Sometimes I pair with others who have extensive experience in other languages and can bring that perspective into the challenges. I’d say one of the most rewarding aspects of the pairing system is when someone discusses a structurally different way of approaching a problem. After discussing that strategy, I really enjoy adding in my own knowledge and style to really create a collaborative solution.
Pairing does have its small hiccups though. On my very first pairing session, my partner typed his own syntax while I was driving. I didn’t think it would be a problem when I read about the driver/navigator dynamic when I was reading the handbook, but it’s actually really annoying. Another fault is if someone is significantly behind in the material causing the session to be longer than necessary. I do enjoy teaching, but sometimes the pairing sessions turn more into a teaching session.
<br>
The feedback I got was surprisingly positive, not because I thought I was an ass to anybody, but because everyone was so honest and open. Whenever I am teaching a new trick or method to someone, I take great care not to step on their toes and always ask if they are familiar with the methods. This was more of a precaution to not annoy anyone, but I was surprised on how positively that gesture was received. So I learned that having mutual respect for someone’s knowledge goes a long way when I am trying to teach new material. In the same regard, I remain as open as possible to new approaches because I am very aware my coding noobness. So the feedback has taught me a lot. I think I’ll try to dig a little deeper in my reflections to people, because I do tend to stay on the more harmonious side instead of giving more constructive criticism.
