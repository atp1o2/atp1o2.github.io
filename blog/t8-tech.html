		<!-- INSERT BLOG HERE -->
		Rails is actually a RubyGem that you can install and used as a package library in Ruby. It is a framework for that combines Ruby with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, allowing you to build dynamic and complex websites. So why are so many budding developers hearing about this ruby on rails mumbo-jumbo when they are learning about the ruby language? In the past, web developers would design websites with their own personal style, often using structures of code that was difficult to dissect for any other developer. It’s like try copying another artists painting style. They would also have to master the language to understand and implement every function needed to complete a project. Like I said earlier, rails provide an infrastructure for a dev to build his or her website on. Beneficial because, this infrastructure is more “standardized”, which allows other rails developers to understand and improve on the code faster. Ruby and ruby on rails provide a lot of directives that enable easier usage of functions; more “magic”, if you will. Finally, ruby on rails can access an open-source library of RubyGems, giving the developer, literally, a world library of functions to his disposal.
